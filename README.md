# Kaggle-NLP-text-classification

Objective:

Review Methods for text classification and understand the dataset.
The transfer learning in the notebook Deep Learning section is run on Colab.

Visualiztion:
- Frequent words in flagged records.

To do:

* Add lemmatization - won't do this because of small number of records and words

* Add a double bar chart with both flagged and not flagged count

* The transformer crashed. See if you can add anything to use it without blowing up the colab.
